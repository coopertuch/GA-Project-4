## Current Features

On the Home/Workout page, workouts are listed with the user's name and muscle group, followed by form, breathing, and progression tips; users can add workouts from this page using the + sign. Clicking into a workout will then display all lifts associated with that user's muscle group, with the exercise, desired reps, and weight; users can add lifts from this page using the + sign, in addition to being able to edit and delete both the workout and lift info from this page. The Lifts page will display all lifts, where users can click on lifts to view, edit, or delete. To add, edit, or delete workouts and lifts, users must sign up and be logged in; users do not need to be logged in to just view workouts and lifts.

## Features in Progress

Features in progress include adding the ability for users to customize their feed, filter workouts by user and workout type, and filter all lifts by workout type.
